`BubbleFinder` computes **all snarls**, **superbubbles**, and **ultrabubbles** in genomic and pangenomic **GFA** and **GBZ** graphs (i.e. bidirected graphs).

All algorithms run in **linear time** in the size of the input graph (`O(|V|+|E|)`). Ultrabubbles are computed using two modes: **oriented mode** (default), which orients the bidirected graph and reduces to directed weak superbubbles, and **doubled mode** (`--doubled`), which builds a doubled directed graph with no connected-component restriction but uses more RAM.

### Snarls and superbubbles via SPQR trees

BubbleFinder first builds the undirected version of the input bidirected graph, then uses the [SPQR trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPQR_tree) of its biconnected components to identify all snarls and superbubbles.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `snarls` computes **all** snarls and aims to replicate the behavior of [`vg snarls -a -T`](https://github.com/vgteam/vg), **but** `vg` outputs only a pruned, linear-size *snarl decomposition*.  
> Therefore, `BubbleFinder` may output **more** snarls than `vg snarls`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Empirical performance (snarls & superbubbles).** Benchmarks and theory are reported in [Sena, Politov et al., 2025](#ref-sena-politov2025).

### Ultrabubbles via linear-time orientation + reduction to weak superbubbles

Ultrabubbles use a different approach (not SPQR-based). BubbleFinder first orients the bidirected graph into a directed graph using a DFS-based procedure, then runs a linear-time directed weak superbubble algorithm on the result and maps the output back to ultrabubbles in the original bidirected graph.

> [!NOTE]
> The ultrabubble method, correctness proof, and benchmarks are described in [Harviainen et al., 2026](#ref-harviainen2026).

## Quickstart

### Prebuilt Linux binary

Download the latest release:

https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder/releases/latest

```bash
./BubbleFinder --help
./BubbleFinder snarls -g example/tiny1.gfa -o tiny1.snarls
```

### Conda / Bioconda

```bash
conda create -n bubblefinder_env -c conda-forge -c bioconda bubblefinder
conda activate bubblefinder_env
./BubbleFinder --help
```

### Build from source (Linux)

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder && \
cd BubbleFinder && \
cmake -S . -B build && \
cmake --build build -j <NUM_THREADS> && \
mv build/BubbleFinder .
```

Replace `<NUM_THREADS>` with the number of parallel build jobs (e.g. `-j 8`). Omitting `-j` builds single-threaded.

**Dependencies** are handled automatically by the build system:
- A Rust toolchain with Cargo is required for `spqr-rust`.
- [spqr-rust](https://github.com/algbio/spqr-rust) is the SPQR backend and is built with Cargo.
- [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) is detected on the system. If not found, it is fetched and built from source.
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (`libcrypto`) must be available on the system.
- OpenMP is optional; when found, it enables intra-block parallelism.
- GBZ support pulls in four submodules, all under `external/gbz/` and built automatically:
  - [gbwtgraph](https://github.com/jltsiren/gbwtgraph) is the GBZ/GBWTGraph library
  - [gbwt](https://github.com/jltsiren/gbwt) is the GBWT index
  - [sdsl-lite](https://github.com/vgteam/sdsl-lite) provides low-level data structures
  - [libhandlegraph](https://github.com/vgteam/libhandlegraph) is the handle graph interface

## Commands overview

| Command | Typical input | Output endpoints | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `snarls` | bidirected GFA / GBZ | oriented incidences (`a+`, `d-`) | uses compressed SPQR path; may output cliques |
| `superbubbles` | bidirected GFA / GBZ (default) or directed (`--directed`) | segment IDs (`a`, `e`) in bidirected mode; oriented IDs (`a+`, `e-`) in directed mode | computed on doubled directed graph + orientation projection (bidirected) or directly (directed) |
| `ultrabubbles` | bidirected GFA / GBZ | oriented incidences | oriented mode (default), doubled mode (`--doubled`), or SPQR weak-superbubble backend (`--spqr-weak-superbubbles`) |
| `spqr-tree` | GFA / GBZ only | `.spqr` v0.4 | connected components + BC-tree + SPQR decomposition |

All commands except `spqr-tree` exclude trivial bubbles by default (use `-T` to include them), and are validated against a brute-force implementation on randomly generated graphs (see [Validation](../../wiki/Validation) on the Wiki).

For a detailed walkthrough of all execution paths, see the [Flowchart](../../wiki/Flowchart) on the Wiki.

## Running BubbleFinder

```text
./BubbleFinder <command> -g <graphFile> -o <outputFile> [options]
```

Available commands:
- `superbubbles` find superbubbles (bidirected by default, use `--directed` for directed mode)
- `snarls` find snarls (bidirected GFA or GBZ; compressed SPQR path)
- `ultrabubbles` find ultrabubbles (oriented mode by default, use `--doubled` or `--spqr-weak-superbubbles` for alternative backends)
- `spqr-tree` output the connected components, BC-tree and SPQR decomposition in `.spqr` v0.4 format

> [!WARNING]
> In oriented mode (default), `ultrabubbles` requires **at least one tip or one cut vertex per connected component** in the input graph (otherwise it will fail). Use `--doubled` if your graph has tipless and cut-vertex-free connected components.

### Input data

| Extension | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `.gfa` / `.gfa1` | GFA1 | Graphical Fragment Assembly format |
| `.gbz` | GBZ | vg/gbwtgraph binary format; topology-only loading is used by default |
| `.graph` | BubbleFinder text | Simple directed edge list (see below) |

BubbleFinder `.graph` text format:
- first line: two integers `n` (number of node IDs) and `m` (number of directed edges)
- next `m` lines: `u v` (one directed edge per line)
- `u` and `v` are arbitrary node identifiers (strings without whitespace)

Force the input format with `--gfa`, `--gfa-directed`, or `--graph`. Input files can be compressed (gzip, bzip2, xz), auto-detected from the file suffix.

> [!NOTE]
> `spqr-tree` currently requires **GFA or GBZ input**.

### Command-line options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-g <file>` | Input graph file (possibly compressed) |
| `-o <file>` | Output file |
| `-j <threads>` | Number of threads |
| `--gfa` | Force GFA input (bidirected) |
| `--gfa-directed` | Force GFA input interpreted as directed graph |
| `--graph` | Force `.graph` text format |
| `--directed` | Interpret graph as directed (for `superbubbles`) |
| `--doubled` | Use doubled-graph algorithm (for `ultrabubbles`) |
| `--spqr-weak-superbubbles` | Use the SPQR weak-superbubble backend (for `ultrabubbles`) |
| `--sp-compress <mode>` | Snarls SPQR compression mode: `macro-direct` (default), `on`, `off`, or `instrument` |
| `-T`, `--include-trivial` | Include trivial bubbles in output |

## Output format

All commands write plain text to the file given by `-o <outputFile>`. The first line is a single integer `N` (the number of result lines that follow), and lines 2 through N+1 each contain one result.

Each result line encodes one or more **unordered pairs of endpoints**. What an "endpoint" looks like depends on the command: `snarls` and `ultrabubbles` use **oriented incidences** (e.g. `a+`, `d-`), `superbubbles` in bidirected mode uses **segment IDs without orientation** (e.g. `a`, `e`), and `superbubbles --directed` uses **oriented IDs** (e.g. `a+`, `e-`).

With `--compact-output-chains`, consecutive output pairs are merged into maximal chains; each line contains the two external endpoints of one chain.

<details>
<summary><strong>Snarls</strong></summary>

By default, **trivial snarls** are excluded. Use `-T` / `--include-trivial` to include them.

**With `-T`**: each line contains at least two incidences. A line with `k ≥ 2` incidences encodes **all unordered pairs** among them (clique representation).

Example on `example/tiny1.gfa`:

```bash
./BubbleFinder snarls -T -g example/tiny1.gfa -o example/tiny1.snarls --gfa
```

```text
2
g+ k-
a+ d- f+ g-
```

- `g+ k-` → single pair `{g+, k-}`.
- `a+ d- f+ g-` → all pairs: `{a+, d-}`, `{a+, f+}`, `{a+, g-}`, `{d-, f+}`, `{d-, g-}`, `{f+, g-}`.

**Without `-T`** (default): cliques are expanded, trivial pairs filtered, each line contains exactly two oriented incidences.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Superbubbles</strong></summary>

In **bidirected mode** (default), each result line contains exactly two segment IDs (no orientation):

```text
3
a b
e f
b e
```

These pairs are obtained after running the superbubble algorithm on the doubled directed graph and applying the orientation projection (see [Internals](../../wiki/Internals) on the Wiki).

In **directed mode** (`--directed`), each result line contains two oriented IDs:

```text
3
a+ b-
e+ f-
b+ e-
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ultrabubbles</strong></summary>

A flat list of endpoint pairs where each endpoint is an oriented incidence (`segmentID+` / `segmentID-`):

```text
N
a+ d-
g+ k-
...
```

Both oriented mode (default) and doubled mode (`--doubled`) produce the same output format.

To also output the **hierarchical nesting structure**, use `--clsd-trees <file>`. Each line in that file is a rooted tree in parenthesized form:

- leaf bubble: `<X,Y>`
- internal bubble: `(child1,...,childk)<X,Y>`

where `X` and `Y` are oriented incidences such as `a+` or `d-`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SPQR-tree</strong></summary>

The `spqr-tree` command writes a `.spqr` file according to the [SPQR tree file format](https://github.com/sebschmi/SPQR-tree-file-format) specification (version **v0.4**). BubbleFinder writes the header:

```text
H v0.4 https://github.com/sebschmi/SPQR-tree-file-format
```

For details on line types and semantics, refer to the specification repository.
