# BubbleFinder

## About
`BubbleFinder` is a program computing all snarls and superbubbles in genomic and pangenomic GFA graphs (i.e. bidirected graphs). `BubbleFinder` computes in linear time a representation of all snarls whose size is linear in the size of the input graph. Superbubbles are already known to be representable in linear time, as pairs of endpoints.

`BubbleFinder` exploits the [SPQR trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPQR_tree) of the biconnected components of the undirected counterparts of the input bidirected graph, and traverses them efficiently to identify all snarls and superbubbles.

BubbleFinder supports two main modes:

- `snarls`: computes **all** snarls and is supposed to replicate the behavior of [vg snarl](https://github.com/vgteam/vg) (when run with parameters `-a -T`). Note that `vg snarl` prunes some snarls to output only a linear number of snarls; thus `BubbleFinder` finds more snarls than `vg snarl`.
- `superbubbles`: computes superbubbles in a (virtually) doubled representation of the bidirected graph and is supposed to replicate the behavior of [BubbleGun](https://github.com/fawaz-dabbaghieh/bubble_gun). Since superbubbles are classically defined on **directed** graphs, BubbleFinder first runs the algorithm on this doubled directed representation, then projects the results back to unordered pairs of segment IDs (see [Orientation projection](#orientation-projection)). Notice that BubbleGun also reports weak superbubbles, i.e. for a bubble with entry `s` and exit `t`, it also reports the structures which also have an edge from `t` to `s` (thus the interior of the bubble is not acyclic).

# <a id="installation"></a>1. Installation

At the moment, building from source has been tested only on Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder && \
cd BubbleFinder && \
cmake -S . -B build && \
cmake --build build -j <NUM_THREADS> && \
mv build/BubbleFinder .
```

Replace `<NUM_THREADS>` with the number of parallel build jobs you want to use (for example `-j 8`). Omitting `-j` will build single‑threaded but more slowly.

Now `BubbleFinder` is in the root directory.

`conda` distributions for both Linux and macOS will be supported in the very near future.

## <a id="output-format"></a>2.1 Output format

All commands write plain text with the same global structure:

- **First line**: a single integer `N`, the number of *result lines* that follow.
- **Lines 2..N+1**: one *result line* per line.

Each result line encodes one or more **unordered pairs of endpoints**.  
What an "endpoint" looks like depends on the command:

- `snarls`: endpoints are **oriented incidences**, e.g. `a+`, `d-`.
- `superbubbles` / `directed-superbubbles`: endpoints are **segment IDs without orientation**, e.g. `a`, `e`.

The only difference between commands is:

- `snarls` may output **cliques** (a line with ≥ 2 endpoints encodes all pairs between them),
- `superbubbles` and `directed-superbubbles` always output **exactly one pair per line**.

### 2.1.1 Snarls (`snarls` command)

Used by the `snarls` command.

- After the header, each line contains **at least two incidences**, separated by whitespace.
- An **incidence** is a segment (or node) ID followed by an orientation sign, e.g. `a+`, `d-`.

Example on the tiny graph in `example/tiny1.gfa`:

```bash
./BubbleFinder snarls -g example/tiny1.gfa -o example/tiny1.snarls --gfa
```

This produces:

```text
2
g+ k-
a+ d- f+ g-
```

Interpretation:

- The first line `2` means: **2 result lines follow**.
- Each result line with `k ≥ 2` incidences encodes **all unordered pairs among them**:
  - `g+ k-` encodes the single pair `{g+, k-}`.
  - `a+ d- f+ g-` encodes the clique of pairs:
    `{a+, d-}`, `{a+, f+}`, `{a+, g-}`, `{d-, f+}`, `{d-, g-}`, `{f+, g-}`.

So the snarl output is just a compact way to write many pairs at once:  
**one line = all pairs between the listed incidences**.

### 2.1.2 Superbubbles (`superbubbles`, `directed-superbubbles`)

Used by:

- `superbubbles` (bidirected graphs from GFA),
- `directed-superbubbles` (directed graphs: `--graph` or `--gfa-directed`).

Here each result line contains **exactly two tokens**, e.g.:

```text
3
a b
e f
b e
```

Interpretation:

- Each line `u v` is a single **unordered pair of segment IDs** `{u, v}`.
- IDs are segment names from GFA `S` records (no `+/-` orientation).

For `superbubbles`, these pairs are obtained after running the superbubble algorithm on the **doubled directed graph** and then applying the **orientation projection** (see [Orientation projection](#orientation-projection)).

## <a id="gfa-format-and-bidirected-graphs"></a>GFA format and bidirected graphs

The tiny example `example/tiny1.gfa` is interpreted as the following bidirected graph:

<p align="center">
  <img src="example/tiny1.png" alt="Tiny bidirected example graph (tiny1.gfa)">
</p>

In this graph, the bidirected edge `{a+, b+}` is represented in the GFA file by the link:

```text
L	a	+	b	-	0M
```

This is because GFA links are directed. To build the bidirected graph on which snarls are computed, we apply the following rule to every GFA link

```text
a x b y
```

(where `x, y ∈ {+, -}`): we flip the second orientation `y` to `¬y` and create the bidirected edge `{a x, b ¬y}`. All snarls are then computed on this bidirected graph.

## <a id="orientation-projection"></a>Orientation projection

Superbubbles are classically defined on **directed** graphs, whereas GFA graphs are **bidirected**. In `superbubbles` mode, BubbleFinder therefore first converts the bidirected graph into a doubled directed graph, where each segment `v` has two oriented copies `v+` and `v-`, and superbubbles are detected between oriented endpoints (e.g. `(a+, e-)` and its mirror `(e+, a-)`).

To report results at the level of segments, independently of the arbitrary orientation chosen in the doubled graph, we apply an **orientation projection**:

- mirror pairs like `(a+, e-)` and `(e+, a-)` are treated as the same bubble;
- we then drop the `+/-` signs and sort the two segment names.

The final output is a single unordered pair of segment IDs, e.g. `a e`. This process is illustrated below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="example/projection-example.svg" alt="Orientation projection example">
</p>

In this example, the directed graph on segments has three superbubbles with endpoints `(a, b)`, `(b, e)` and `(e, f)`. After running the superbubble algorithm on the doubled graph and applying the orientation projection, BubbleFinder reports exactly these three pairs in its standard output format (see [Output format](#output-format)).

## <a id="algorithm-correctness"></a>Algorithm correctness 

This repository includes a brute-force implementation and a random test harness to validate both the snarl and superbubble algorithms.

### Brute-force implementation

A brute-force program is built together with BubbleFinder from source and resides in the `build` directory after compilation. It can compute snarls and, in a different mode, superbubbles on a given GFA file. In the examples below we refer to this binary as `./build/snarls_bf`.

To run the brute-force program on **snarls** for a given GFA file:

```bash
cd build
./snarls_bf gfaGraphPath
```

The brute-force program outputs results in a format consumed by `src/bruteforce.py`, which then compares them with BubbleFinder’s output. The same brute-force engine is also used for superbubble validation via the `--superbubbles` mode, which takes care of running the binary and parsing its output.

### Random testing with `src/bruteforce.py`

We also include a generator of random graphs and a driver script that compares the brute-force implementation with BubbleFinder. The script is `src/bruteforce.py`, and it can operate in two modes:

- **Snarls** (default)
- **Superbubbles** (via `--superbubbles`)

#### Snarls

To run the random tests on snarls (for example, on 100 random graphs):

```bash
python3 src/bruteforce.py \
  --bruteforce-bin ./build/snarls_bf \
  --bubblefinder-bin ./BubbleFinder \
  --n-graphs 100
```

This will:

- generate random GFA graphs,
- run the brute-force snarl finder,
- run BubbleFinder in snarl mode,
- compare their outputs (missing / extra pairs / segfaults),
- and additionally check that BubbleFinder’s output is consistent across different thread counts if you pass several values to `--threads`.

#### Superbubbles

To run the same style of tests for superbubbles, pass the `--superbubbles` flag:

```bash
python3 src/bruteforce.py \
  --superbubbles \
  --bruteforce-bin ./build/superbubbles_bf \
  --bubblefinder-bin ./BubbleFinder \
  --n-graphs 100
```

To run superbubble tests with multiple thread configurations and check result consistency, you can run:

```bash
python3 src/bruteforce.py \
  --superbubbles \
  --bruteforce-bin ./build/superbubbles_bf \
  --bubblefinder-bin ./BubbleFinder \
  --n-graphs 100 \
  --threads 1 4 8
```

Any divergence or error is reported, and if you pass `--keep-failing`, the script will save the corresponding GFA and BubbleFinder outputs in `/tmp` for manual inspection.
